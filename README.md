<h2 align="center">Hello and welcome to my Github!</h2>

🌕 My name is Yison, sometimes known as Nimphu.

🧑‍🎓 I am studying software engineering at <a href="https://42wolfsburg.de/who-are-we/">42Wolfsburg.</a>

🌱 I love learning! I am studying programming in C and C++, as well as learning German while I study in Germany.

🖥️ I am interested in software development, art, game development and game design. I have been participating in Game Jams and use the Godot game engine.

🌎 I aspire to be someone who has a positive impact, and someone who is a good influence on others.
